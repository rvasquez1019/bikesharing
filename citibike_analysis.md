# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

I have created a Tableu story to present the possibility of opening a Citi Bike in Des Moines, IA based on the data presented of New York City Citi Bike.

# Story 1:  Avg. Trip Duration

The two cities hold the majority of people within the age group who are most likely to use the bikes.  New York City's population has more than 10 times the amount of people than Des Moines, IA.   

# Story 2:  Bike Usage

New York Citibike has logged a tremendous amount of bike usage per location.  In my opinion Des Moines, IA would not come close to logging in the amount of bike usage as New York City.  This is due to the greater population of New York City.  

# Story 3:  Aug Peek Hours

Peek hours run an average between 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in some cases.  Den Moines citizens spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work.  In New York City is more heavily dense with more people that the City Bikes are used daily to maneuver around the city whatever New Yorkers destinations might be.  

# Story 4:  Top Start Locations

As you can see on the map Manhattan is heavily populated with several dots representing the locations of the City Bikes used daily.  I cannot see Des Moines having the same representation on their city.  The best things to do in Des Moines are all walking destinations that families enjoy.  See list below.  

#### What are the best things to do in Des Moines?

- Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden
- John & Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park
- Des Moines Art Route
- Adventureland Park
- Prairie Meadows Casino Racetrack & Hotel
- Blank Park Zoo
- Living History Farms
- Outdoor Trails

# Story 5:  Top End Locations

The majority of the top end locations are listed again heavily populated in the Citi Bike use as you can see in the map with the orange and red dots representing the Citi Bike's final destination. Des Moines, IA will not benefit on the unique concept.   

# Summary 

New York City being the number one city in America of the most people and Des Moines, IA population being at 214,237 as of July 1, 2019, in my opinion Des Moines will not come close to becoming a profitable Citi Bike business.
